# lcc sharepoint toolkit
A collection of Web parts and JavaScript files to be used by Leeds City Council SharePoint applications.

To publish a new [NPM version of the toolkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lcc_sharepoint_toolkit), bump the version in the VERSION.txt file.  This will kick off a [Travis CI build](https://travis-ci.org/lccgov/lcc_sharepoint_toolkit_npm), which will publish the updated package to the NPM registry.
